This is my first official daily post - it's really not anything crazy, but it is exciting... I think.

## Day One of Forever

So today I built this blog with Hugo, I got my Shopify store deployed. I wrote a blog post on that Shopify store. I wrote about half of my next [Dev.to](https://dev.to/GeauxWeisbeck4) Cool Algorithms Series post and then also did a lot of reading on posts about web dev. 

I tried a couple other tools I can't think of right now, but it will come back to me. I guess I also kind of did my reflection for the sprint week number 22.

Sprint week 22 was fucking awful - I got literally like nothing on my list done. It was a challenging and trying week, so no wonder. But I still could have at least gotten like one thing off the list lol. 

There have been a lot of dddldldldldldldlddddddddddd in my code and in my blog posts the last week or so. I've been exhausted, but also have had a hotel room for about two weeks and I think the half of a year being homeless is catching up to me physically and somewhat mentally. I still feel ambitious and ready to take on my new gig and am excited about doing my job, but I am mentally exhausted from just everything from this shitty few months of hell that Lisa and I have had to endure.

I need to finish up before it gets too late and is the 7th (it actually is the 7th, this is just what I would have said if it was the 6th though). I guess I spent a lot of time learning Vue, Near, and Lit the last few days - oh and more of Rust learning.

Thank you once again for reading my exciting daily journal - until tomorrow!

Love,

Andrew
