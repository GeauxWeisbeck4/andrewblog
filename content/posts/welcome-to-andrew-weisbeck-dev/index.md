# Welcome to Andrew Weisbeck.Dev 

Welcome to my new daily journaling/blogging website where I share my daily work, education, and adventure stories with y'all.

I wanted to create a blog that I can share all the interesting things I do everyday with the world and also wanted to give Hugo a solid try from scratch, so that's how we ended up here! I really like this theme I selected and kind of have fallen in love with Hugo as a static site generator. I will get more into that in the coming days as I blog more about creating this website.

## In Need of a More Personal Dev Diary

I wanted to create a site that allowed me to just kind of explore more of the things I'm learning each day in a more casual way. I like to write casually and with kind of a half-serious, half-smart ass approach to exploring my daily activities. The reason being is that I don't like to be serious all the time and I don't always find technical writing to be as fun as just rambling.

Don't get me wrong - I do like technical writing, but there is just something about letting a stream of consciousness flow out of you and onto the paper/screen and share it with the world. I like my morning pages every day, but those stay personal with me forever (and for reasons that are very good). It serves a purpose I guess, but then I don't get to share my full personality in my writing.

## Approach to This Blog 

So this is going to be Andrew's Dev Journal and more... or something like that. LOL. I haven't officially decided on the name, but I'm going to change it to something on Netlify after I finish this post. But there's going to be a highly specific approach to this blog! Not...

Really, it'll be kinda like one of those T.I.L (Today I Learned) blogs, but each day can vary from learning about specific developer things, working on a project, or about learning something new like that the Nebraska Cornhuskers just fired another coach for the 15th time in 10 years. Really, I will try to stay close to home with programming and business, but you never know with me. 

Well I hope this post was a little informative about my intentions with this new blog I've shared with you and the world. I hope you enjoy it and subscribe to my newsletter so you can stay up to date with all my fun content!

Love,

Andrew
