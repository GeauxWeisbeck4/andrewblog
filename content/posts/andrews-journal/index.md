# Andrews Journal

- # Sunday
	- It is Sudnay, very early in the morning. Still almost Saturday  as a matter of fact.
	- ## End of Week 21 Reflection
		- What a crazy busy week. More to come on this shortly.
		- Well, well, well... First "days" on my new job. I reviewed the codebase for Qstn.us and gave some recommendations to the founder, Orrin. It was a lot of code to work through and a lot is going on there, but I am excited about this project. I am going to start working on it this week for this sprint. I'm also going to hop back into workin on [[GeauxAgile.js]].
			- I will start that out with these new sections in my #[[Daily Notes]] that are going to be related to each "sprint week". I've spent a lot of time (believe me, A LOT of time) researching different writing tools. I have found two that I think are going to be the backbone of my #GeauxAgile.js application and then the final product will be .
				- [[Logseq]] of course is the first part of this little note-taking, digital-gardening, agile tool. It's the place I start out each day and keep working all day. It's the place where the working happens - sort of behind the scenes - then I will push it up to:
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- [[Notion]] this is kind of like the "middleware" or CMS for the whole framework and #[[Digital Garden]]. I will edit things here so I don't let super personal things or passwords go through to the public.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- [[Next.js]] will be the front end because of you know, its easy and rad. 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- I guess you can also think of Notion as sort of a ORM too as well. I would like to put it in a #MongoDB or PostgreSQL database
		- Then I'll be better at doing my gardening in public - automate it. That's the way to make things easier to do. Make it so I don't have to think about the logistics.
	- Well it's almost 12am/midnight, so let me run down a couple more things I got going this week.
		- I need to start writing out some of the code from Qstn.us into Deno to give a good example of how much faster and better it is.
			- I also need to get in on that Deno Web #3 project so I can have a hand in developing that - make me the big player in the game.
		- Build out my [[GeauxWeisbeck4.dev]] in Deno as well - decide on Ultra.js or Fresh. I think we know the answer but still want to play around a little bit to see which I prefer.
		- I've already mentioned the #[[Digital Garden]], but I need to start my #Medium publication.
			- Start writing for #Medium period.
			- And Dev.to
			- and Hashnode
			- When I can, Tealfeed and my own personal blogs to build up my SEO
		- Work on some harder #Projects from scratch as well.
	- # Number #1 though, is be consistent with the agile work and setting goals, like this one.
	- # Number #2 - Get into a better routine of sleeping at night, at least a little bit. Some sleeping time with Lisa.
	- # Number #3 - Get an apartment when I get some money. We need to move in somewhere and take care of ourselves.
		- Alright, it is time to get to week number 22? or 23? I'll figure that out and fix this, Goodnight and Good week!
