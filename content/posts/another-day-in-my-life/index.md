	- Quick note:
	- ### The Four Principles of Web Accessibility #accessability
		- The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) outline four principles of web accessibility. These are often remembered with the acronym POUR:
			- 1.  **Perceivable**: Users must be able to perceive the information being presented. This means that users must be able to perceive the information with one of their senses. For example, providing text alternatives for non-text content allows it to be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language.
			- 2.  **Operable**: Users must be able to operate the interface. This means that users must be able to interact with the site and its navigation components. For example, all functionality should be available from a keyboard for those who cannot use a mouse.
			- 3.  **Understandable**: Users must be able to understand the information and the operation of the user interface. This means that users must be able to understand both the content of the site and how to use the site’s interface. For example, the site should operate in predictable ways, and explanations should be provided for concepts that may be difficult to understand.
			- 4.  **Robust**: Users must be able to access the content as technologies advance. As technology evolves, the site should remain accessible. For example, the site should be compatible with current and future user tools.
	- ### Making Your Website Accessible #accessability
		- There are many ways to make your website accessible. Here are a few examples:
			- Use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to structure your content. These elements provide information about the type of content contained within them, which helps assistive technologies understand your site.
			- Provide alternative text for images. This text should describe the content of the image. If an image is purely decorative and doesn’t provide any information, you can use an empty alt attribute (`alt=""`).
			- Ensure that your site is fully navigable with a keyboard. This includes providing a visible focus state for interactive elements, ensuring that all interactive elements are reachable with the tab key, and providing skip links that allow users to skip over lengthy navigation menus.
			- Use sufficient color contrast. Text should have a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against its background to ensure that people with low vision can read it.
	- Ok so we are onto another day of this week. I'll admit, a bunch of time was wasted yesterday... It was hard to get focused because I was exhausted and didn't necessarily feel real great. But now its time for me to be in the mother fuckin zone. Let's go!
